# Markowitz-PortFolio
This project highlights the significance of Markowitz PortFolio in Stock trading.
I have used the Nifty50 data of 50 stocks over the time period of 2016-20, i.e. , 5 years.
For the First part, I calculated Compunded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Volatiliy and Sharpe Ratio for all the stocks whose data is available. Based on the higest Sharpe Ratio, Top 15 stocks are taken into consideration for further trading.
Next, I used those 15 stocks and find the ideal or optimised weights, and thus the distribution of money and the number of shares among them which would provide us the optimal and most profitable output.
Finally, I held those stocks over a testing period of 6 months and we use the data from yahoo finance. I evaluated and compared the metrics with respect to the portfolio and the benchmark(nifty50). 
I finally reduced the investment to 4 stocks and found the most ideal investment and repeated the metric evaluation process.
